# AnnaAna-Lipi

**Mana Binary, Mana Lipi — Convert your text into Anna & Ana!**

AnnaAna-Lipi is a React web app that reimagines binary code through the lens of Telugu culture.
Instead of `0` and `1`, the app encodes text into **“Anna”** and **“Ana”** — complete with audio playback, South Indian styling, and playful interaction.
